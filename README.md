Encrypter/Decrypter: 

This project implements a basic shift cypher encrypt/decrypt algorithm.  This can be easily replaced with a better algorithm noted by the comments within their respective functions.  The main purpose of this project was to implement a functioning GUI and working with File I/O.


LogicGates:
This project implements a linked list to create a virtual logic gate network.  The user inputs the start gates (Type and Values) and proceeding gates.  The network will then output the final value to the user.  The main purpose of this project is to model a logical circuit using the Linked List Data Structure.
