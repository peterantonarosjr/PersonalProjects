# PersonalProjects

Encrypter/Decrypter: 
This project implements a basic shift cypher encrypt/decrypt algorithm.  This can be easily replaced with a better algorithm noted by the comments within their respective functions.  The main purpose of this project was to implement a functioning GUI and working with File I/O.

Space Invaders:
This was just a fun weekend project to attempt and recreate the classic Space Invaders game.  If and when the time permits I will continue to add more features and updates for the game.  As of 9/8/20 I am busy with school and other more intensive projects.

NumJava:
Currently working on developing Numpy, but for Java.  This will also include some of my own new ideas, which will provide further utility.
